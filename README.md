## Getting Started

Command to run Storybook:

npm run storybook

## TODOs

* It'd be nice if the select element in the Select component were styled with Tailwind
* Add a hover effect to the left arrow in the ModalHeader
* Consider storing jsx files in subfolders to reduce scrolling and keep similar and related components organized
